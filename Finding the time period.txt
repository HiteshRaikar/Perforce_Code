Logic explained

input 

inputFilePath = path to the visitors.txt file

logic 

1. First we read the input file and push the time entries in a vector as a pair (enteringTime, leavingTime)
2. we call the fuction findMaxVisitors which take the vector as input
3.  we iterate through the map and we convert the inpput time and output time into minutes
4. in the same loop we  have another for loop where we enter for every minute the number of people in the musume
5. now we have a map of all the minutes and number of visitors in that minute
6 . We then find out the max visitors fro that map
7. now we generate a vector for the minutes for the max visitors
8. in that vector the max and min correspond to the max time and min time .
9 we retur them as a pair .
